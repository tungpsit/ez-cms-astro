2025 was not a loud year for me.
It was a builder year and a thinking year.

I spent most of the year working across both backend and frontend systems. On the backend, I worked with Node, TypeScript, PHP, Laravel, Express, NestJS, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS, GCP and Docker. On the frontend, I worked with React, Next.js, Vue, and modern TypeScript workflows. These were real production systems with real constraints and tradeoffs.

But this year was not just about building. It was about understanding.
I slowed down and started thinking more deeply about architecture, scale, abstractions, and long term impact. I became more intentional about decisions and less interested in clever solutions that only worked in the short term. 
_Clarity started to matter more than speed._

Alongside my technical growth, I spent the year learning French and living within a new culture. Learning a new language forces you to listen more than you speak. It changes how you process ideas and express intent. I realized how closely this mirrors software engineering. You cannot express a good solution until you truly understand the problem.


Because of this shift, I cared less about shipping fast and more about meaning. 
I asked better questions. What problem does this system actually solve. How will this decision age. What happens when this codebase grows.


I worked across different domains including elearning platforms, gaming APIs, and AI products. Each domain reinforced the same lesson. Depth beats speed. 
_Systems tend to fail long before code does._

I also explored AI thoughtfully. I looked into RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), LLM powered tools, and practical SaaS ideas. Instead of chasing hype, I focused on what could be built lean and sustainably.


On the product side, I planned and built real things. I co founded a product and currently close to finishing the MVP. I planned and built a social media post generation tool using NestJS and PostgreSQL with a Nextjs frontend.

Giving back remained important to me, I’m mentoring someone to become a great backend dev, I published an npm package, worked on open source repositories, and wrote developer articles. My goal was to document real fixes and real lessons, not recycled advice.

_2025 taught me that growth can be quiet._
It comes from thinking deeply, learning continuously, and building with intent.

Going into 2026, my focus is clear. Fewer projects, deeper execution, and visible impact.
