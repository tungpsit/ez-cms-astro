**This year marks a big change in my life.**

I originally taught myself web development and many other aspects of the field. At the beginning of the year, I stopped working as a freelance web developer at my web agency, [Concept'Web](https://conceptweb.agency).

I then started a new job as an IAM consultant in cybersecurity. When I began, I didn't feel I had enough knowledge to fully make it my full‑time job, and I struggled for several months. But things are now going much better: I feel more confident, I'm learning a lot every day, and I genuinely love what I do. It's a big shift from web development, which I hardly practice anymore. I contribute much less to open source and side projects (which is a bit sad, but mostly a matter of time), though I still maintain a few of them, including [my personal website](https://thomasbnt.dev) and [a Discord bot that helps eliminate cyberbullying](https://mrrobot.app).

If you're curious about what I wish for this new year, you can read it here:

Outside of work, I also had [a lot of fun shipping several updates to my biggest Discord bot project](https://mrrobot.app/changelog). I notably improved my filter against insults and other offensive language, including homophobia, transphobia, conflicts, sexual content, and degrading comments. I'm very happy with how it's evolving, and I'm proud of the impact it can have on online communities.
